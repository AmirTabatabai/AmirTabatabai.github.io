This is a course aiming at all mathematics and computer science students, covering some parts of modern mathematics from a logical, synthetic structural point of view. It starts with some category theory as the language of mathematical structuralism. Then, it moves to point-free topology and its higher-order versions, Grothendieck toposes and higher toposes to finally reach synthetic functorial geometry and abstract homotopy theory.
