       abstract={In this paper we intend to study implications in their most general form, generalizing different classes of implications including the Heyting implication, sub-structural implications and weak strict implications. Following the topological interpretation of the intuitionistic logic, we will introduce non-commutative spacetimes to provide a more dynamic and subjective interpretation of an intuitionistic proposition. These combinations of space and time are natural sources for well-behaved implications and we will show that their spatio-temporal implications represent any other reasonable abstract implication. Then to provide a faithful well-behaved syntax for abstract implications, we will develop a logical system for the non-commutative spacetimes for which we will present both topological and Kripke semantics. These logics unify sub-structural and sub-intuionistic logics by embracing them as their special fragments.},
