      title={Provability Interpretation of Propositional and Modal Logics}, 
      abstract={In 1933, GÃ¶del introduced a provability interpretation of the propositional intuitionistic logic to establish a formalization for the BHK interpretation. He used the modal system, S4, as a formalization of the intuitive concept of provability and then translated IPC to S4. His work suggested the problem to find a concrete provability interpretation of the modal logic S4. In this paper, we will try to answer this problem. In fact, we will generalize Solovay's provability interpretation of the modal logic GL to capture other modal logics such as K4, KD4 and S4. Then we will use these results to find a formalization for the BHK interpretation and we will show that with different interpretations of the BHK interpretation, we can capture some of the propositional logics such as Intuitionistic logic, minimal logic and Visser-Ruitenburg's basic logic. Moreover, we will show that there is no provability interpretation for any extension of KD45 and also there is no BHK interpretation for the classical propositional logic.},

@article{PrH,
      title={Provability Logics of Hierarchies},
      abstract={The branch of provability logic investigates the provability-based behavior of the mathematical theories. In a more precise way, it studies the relation between a mathematical theory T and a modal logic L via the provability interpretation which interprets the modality as the provability predicate of T. In this paper we will extend this relation to investigate the provability-based behavior of a hierarchy of theories. More precisely, using the modal language with infinitely many modalities, $\{\Box n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$, we will define the hierarchical counterparts of some of the classical modal theories such as K4, KD4, GL and S4. Then we will define their canonical provability interpretations and their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems.},

@article{R,
      title={Russellian Propositional Logic and the BHK Interpretation},
       abstract={The BHK interpretation interprets propositional statements as descriptions of the world of proofs; a world which is hierarchical in nature. It consists of different layers of the concept of proof; the proofs, the proofs about proofs and so on. To describe this hierarchical world, one approach is the Russellian approach in which we use a typed language to reflect this hierarchical nature in the syntax level. In this case, since the connective responsible for this hierarchical behavior is implication, we will use a typed language equipped with a hierarchy of implications, $\{\to_n\}^{\infty}_{n=0}$. In fact, using this typed propositional language, we will introduce the hierarchical counterparts of the logics BPC, EBPC, IPC and FPL and then by proving their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems with respect to their natural BHK interpretations, we will show how these different logics describe different worlds of proofs embodying different hierarchical behaviors. },
