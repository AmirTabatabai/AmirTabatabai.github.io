      title={Provability Interpretation of Propositional and Modal Logics}, 
      abstract={In 1933, Gödel introduced a provability interpretation of the propositional intuitionistic logic to establish a formalization for the BHK interpretation. He used the modal system, S4, as a formalization of the intuitive concept of provability and then translated IPC to S4. His work suggested the problem to find a concrete provability interpretation of the modal logic S4. In this paper, we will try to answer this problem. In fact, we will generalize Solovay's provability interpretation of the modal logic GL to capture other modal logics such as K4, KD4 and S4. Then we will use these results to find a formalization for the BHK interpretation and we will show that with different interpretations of the BHK interpretation, we can capture some of the propositional logics such as Intuitionistic logic, minimal logic and Visser-Ruitenburg's basic logic. Moreover, we will show that there is no provability interpretation for any extension of KD45 and also there is no BHK interpretation for the classical propositional logic.},

@article{U2,
      title={Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Uniform Interpolation}, 
      abstract={In [7] and [8], Iemhoff introduced a connection between the existence of a terminating sequent calculi of a certain kind and the uniform interpolation property of the super-intuitionistic logic that the calculus captures. In this paper, we will generalize this relationship to also cover the substructural setting on the one hand and a much more powerful class of rules on the other. The resulted relationship then provides a uniform method to establish uniform interpolation property for the logics FLe, FLew, CFLe, CFLew, IPC, CPC and their K and KD-type modal extensions. More interestingly though, on the negative side, we will show that no extension of FLe can enjoy a certain natural type of terminating sequent calculus unless it has the uniform interpolation property. It excludes almost all super-intutionistic logics and the logics K4 and S4 from having such a reasonable calculus.},

@article{U1,
      title={Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Craig Interpolation}, 
      abstract={In [6], Iemhoff introduced the notion of a focused axiom and a focused rule as the building blocks for a certain form of sequent calculus which she calls a focused proof system. She then showed how the existence of a terminating focused system implies the uniform interpolation property for the logic that the calculus captures. In this paper we first generalize her focused rules to semi-analytic rules, a dramatically powerful generalization, and then we will show how the semi-analytic calculi consisting of these rules together with our generalization of her focused axioms, lead to the feasible Craig interpolation property. Using this relationship, we first present a uniform method to prove interpolation for different logics from sub-structural logics FLe, FLec, FLew and IPC to their appropriate classical and modal extensions, including the intuitionistic and classical linear logics. Then we will use our theorem negatively, first to show that so many sub-structural logics including Łn, Gn, BL, R and RMe and almost all super-intutionistic logics (except at most seven of them) do not have a semi-analytic calculus. To investigate the case that the logic actually has the Craig interpolation property, we will first define a certain specific type of semi-analytic calculus which we call PPF systems and we will then present a sound and complete PPF calculus for classical logic. However, we will show that all such PPF calculi are exponentially slower than the classical Hilbert-style proof system (or equivalently LK+Cut). We will then present a similar exponential lower bound for a certain form of complete PPF calculi, this time for any super-intuitionistic logic.},

@article{Imp,
      title={Implication via Spacetime}, 
      abstract={In this paper we intend to study implications in their most general form, generalizing different classes of implications including the Heyting implication, sub-structural implications and weak strict implications. Following the topological interpretation of the intuitionistic logic, we will introduce non-commutative spacetimes to provide a more dynamic and subjective interpretation of an intuitionistic proposition. These combinations of space and time are natural sources for well-behaved implications and we will show that their spatio-temporal implications represent any other reasonable abstract implication. Then to provide a faithful well-behaved syntax for abstract implications, we will develop a logical system for the non-commutative spacetimes for which we will present both topological and Kripke semantics. These logics unify sub-structural and sub-intuionistic logics by embracing them as their special fragments.},

@article{PrH,
      title={Provability Logics of Hierarchies},
      abstract={The branch of provability logic investigates the provability-based behavior of the mathematical theories. In a more precise way, it studies the relation between a mathematical theory T and a modal logic L via the provability interpretation which interprets the modality as the provability predicate of T. In this paper we will extend this relation to investigate the provability-based behavior of a hierarchy of theories. More precisely, using the modal language with infinitely many modalities, $\{\Box n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$, we will define the hierarchical counterparts of some of the classical modal theories such as K4, KD4, GL and S4. Then we will define their canonical provability interpretations and their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems.},

@article{R,
      title={Russellian Propositional Logic and the BHK Interpretation},
       abstract={The BHK interpretation interprets propositional statements as descriptions of the world of proofs; a world which is hierarchical in nature. It consists of different layers of the concept of proof; the proofs, the proofs about proofs and so on. To describe this hierarchical world, one approach is the Russellian approach in which we use a typed language to reflect this hierarchical nature in the syntax level. In this case, since the connective responsible for this hierarchical behavior is implication, we will use a typed language equipped with a hierarchy of implications, $\{\to_n\}^{\infty}_{n=0}$. In fact, using this typed propositional language, we will introduce the hierarchical counterparts of the logics BPC, EBPC, IPC and FPL and then by proving their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems with respect to their natural BHK interpretations, we will show how these different logics describe different worlds of proofs embodying different hierarchical behaviors. },
