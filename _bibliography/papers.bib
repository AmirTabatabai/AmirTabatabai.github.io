@article{U2,
      title={Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Interpolation}, 
      abstract={In [7] and [8], Iemhoff introduced a connection between the existence of a terminating sequent calculus of a certain kind and the uniform interpolation property of the super-intuitionistic logic that the calculus captures. In this paper, we will generalize this relationship to also cover the substructural setting on the one hand and a more powerful type of systems called semi-analytic calculi, on the other. To be more precise, we will show that any suciently strong substructural logic with a semi-analytic calculus has Craig interpolation property and in case that the calculus is also terminating, it has uniform interpolation. This relationship then leads to some concrete applications. On the positive side, it provides a uniform method to prove the uniform interpolation property for the logics $FL_e$, $FL_{ew}$, $CFL_e$, $CFL_{ew}$, $IPC$, $CPC$ and some of their $K$ and $KD$-type modal extensions. However, on the negative side the relationship nds its more interesting application to show that many substructural logics including $L_n$, $G_n$, $BL$, $R$ and $RM^e$, almost all super-intutionistic logics (except at most seven of them) and almost all extensions of $S4$ (except thirty seven of them) do not have a semi-analytic calculus. It also shows that the logic $K4$ and almost all extensions of the logic $S4$ (except six of them) do not have a terminating semi-analytic calculus.},

@article{ProofMin,
      title={Proof Mining in Bounded Arithmetic},
       abstract={A computational flow is a pair consisting of a sequence of computational problems of a certain sort and a sequence of computational reductions among them. In this paper we will develop a theory for these computational flows to design a classical direct reading of the Dialectica interpretation. This theory makes a sound and complete interpretation for bounded theories of arithmetic as well as the low complexity statements of strong unbounded systems. We will first use this fact to extract the computational content of the low complexity statements in some bounded theories of arithmetic such as $IU_k$, $T^k_n$, $I\Delta_0(\exp)$ and $\PRA$. And then we will apply the theory on some strong unbounded mathematical theories such as $\PA$ and $\PA+\TI(\alpha)$ using the bridge of continuous cut elimination technique.},

@article{NonDet,
      title={Non-deterministic Flows in Arithmetic},
       abstract={In [1], we have developed a theory of deterministic flows to extend the spirit of the Dialectica interpretation to weak bounded theories of arithmetic. In this paper, we will generalize that theory to introduce the notion of a non-deterministic flow as a sequence of computational problems together with a sequence of non-deterministic version of game reductions. It provides a proof mining method for a general notion of bounded arithmetic which turns out helpful in program  extractions. More specifically, it leads to a characterization of all the higher total search problems in all the higher order bounded theories of arithmetic including the interesting case of $\forall\hat{\Sigma}^b_j$-consequences of the hierarchy $S^k_2$, for $1 \leq j \leq k$. Moreover, the method is also useful to provide another proof for the strong witnessing theorem for the theories $S^k_2$.},

@article{Min,
      title={Mining the Surface: The NP-Search Problems of Arithmetic},
       abstract={One of the elegant achievements in the history of proof theory is the characterization of the provably total recursive functions of the strong theories of arithmetic. This characterization relates the provability of the totality of a function on the one hand and its computability via the ordinal recursion on the theory's proof theoretic ordinal, on the other. Unfortunately, this correspondence is not sufficiently fine-grained to also understand the bounded world of the bounded low complexity functions, i.e., the bounded functions with low complexity definitions.\\

In this paper we intend to develop a refined version of the mentioned correspondence. We will characterize the provably total low complexity functions of a theory via a suitable family of syntactical ordinal-based algorithms. More precisely, we will show that a feasibly defined function is provably total in a theory iff there exists a sequence of $\PV$-provable polynomial time reductions with the length of the proof theoretic ordinal of the theory, starting in a feasibly computable value and ending in the value of the function itself. This characterization is useful in the classification of the feasibly defined bounded functions in a theory. More specifically, it is useful in generalizing the Beckmann's characterization [1] of the total $\NP$-search problems of $\PA$ to any theory with a reasonable ordinal analysis.},

@article{PrM,
      title={Provability Interpretation of Propositional and Modal Logics}, 
      abstract={In 1933, GÃ¶del introduced a provability interpretation of the propositional intuitionistic logic to establish a formalization for the BHK interpretation. He used the modal system, S4, as a formalization of the intuitive concept of provability and then translated IPC to S4. His work suggested the problem to find a concrete provability interpretation of the modal logic S4. In this paper, we will try to answer this problem. In fact, we will generalize Solovay's provability interpretation of the modal logic GL to capture other modal logics such as K4, KD4 and S4. Then we will use these results to find a formalization for the BHK interpretation and we will show that with different interpretations of the BHK interpretation, we can capture some of the propositional logics such as Intuitionistic logic, minimal logic and Visser-Ruitenburg's basic logic. Moreover, we will show that there is no provability interpretation for any extension of KD45 and also there is no BHK interpretation for the classical propositional logic.},

@article{PrH,
      title={Provability Logics of Hierarchies},
      abstract={The branch of provability logic investigates the provability-based behavior of the mathematical theories. In a more precise way, it studies the relation between a mathematical theory T and a modal logic L via the provability interpretation which interprets the modality as the provability predicate of T. In this paper we will extend this relation to investigate the provability-based behavior of a hierarchy of theories. More precisely, using the modal language with infinitely many modalities, $\{\Box n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$, we will define the hierarchical counterparts of some of the classical modal theories such as K4, KD4, GL and S4. Then we will define their canonical provability interpretations and their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems.},

@article{R,
      title={Russellian Propositional Logic and the BHK Interpretation},
       abstract={The BHK interpretation interprets propositional statements as descriptions of the world of proofs; a world which is hierarchical in nature. It consists of different layers of the concept of proof; the proofs, the proofs about proofs and so on. To describe this hierarchical world, one approach is the Russellian approach in which we use a typed language to reflect this hierarchical nature in the syntax level. In this case, since the connective responsible for this hierarchical behavior is implication, we will use a typed language equipped with a hierarchy of implications, $\{\to_n\}^{\infty}_{n=0}$. In fact, using this typed propositional language, we will introduce the hierarchical counterparts of the logics BPC, EBPC, IPC and FPL and then by proving their corresponding soundness-completeness theorems with respect to their natural BHK interpretations, we will show how these different logics describe different worlds of proofs embodying different hierarchical behaviors. },
